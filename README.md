# Cloud-Cover-Detection

**Problem Statement:** Cloud Cover Detection   
Create a Vision Transformer (ViT) based model capable of accurately identifying and
effectively masking clouds in multispectral satellite imagery, per pixel. These models
should significantly elevate the quality of input data for Earth surface analysis,
specifically benefiting analytical tasks reliant on accurate cloud removal and detection.
